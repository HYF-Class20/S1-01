# Saida

## Get to know me ;-)

Hello everyone, my name is Saida and I am excited to have the opportunity to
share a bit about myself with you today. I am 25 years old and originally from
Morocco, but I was born in Spain. I am currently enrolled in a Master's degree
program at the University of Antwerpen, where I am pursuing my passion for
technology.

Before that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Political Sciences, but my
interest in coding began in 2022 when I attended an introduction to coding
program called She Codes organized by Deloitte. After that experience, I knew
that I wanted to pursue a career in technology.

During my Master's degree, I had the opportunity to participate in a three-week
bootcamp where I was introduced to Python and a variety of libraries. I
absolutely loved it! Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of
interests, including music, travel, reading, food, and painting.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I look forward
to connecting with all of you!
