# ABOUT ME

## WHO AM I

Well, hello there!

My name is `Gabriella Brigitte LOHY`. Born in `Jakarta, Indonesia` on **1989**.

My education background is `tourism`. I love traveling that's why I studied
tourism and made a living from that.

### WHY LEARNING CODING?

#### FIRST LOVE

I do not have any knowledge about ICT. By `ICT` I mean coding and stuff. I do
love computer and tech since I was young.

When I was 10 years old, me and my family went to a shopping centre. There was 1
shop that really catched my attention.

It was souvenir shop. **BUT** not an ordinary souvenir shop!

They sell :

- Tea mug with your photo on it
- Your photo on a t-shirt
- And so on,,,

I kept standing there watching the employee design/editing photo of a customer
to be printed on a t-shirt.

I am not intrested to have a t-shirt with my photo on it, instead I was so
intrested with the process. It was new in Indonesia _(year 1999)_

Then I asked my parents to buy me a computer. I said to them _"I want to doing
stuff like that employees in the souvenir shop. If they can do it, I am sure I
can do as well"_

The next day I got my brand new computer! :heart_eyes: **WITH A CPU!!**
:stuck_out_tongue:

After that we went to a software shop. I memorized the name of the software that
they used in the souvenir shop. I bought that one! I taught myself how to print
a photo on t-shirt, bought a printer `Lexmark! still remember the brand` and
iron-on-paper _(a special printing paper to be transferred to t-shirt)_, and
started making money of it! Got a lot of buy order from neighbours, family and
friends of my parents. **YUP! A 10 years old kid made her own pocket money**

So that was my first experience in computer world, let's say `my first love!`
:nerd_face:

Since then I kept learning how to crop and put background on a photo, selling
birthday invitation, editing video from camcorder using pinnacle software, and
so on,,

#### WHY TOURISM SCHOOL AND NOT ICT

So in Indonesia after primary school, we have junior high school and senior high
school.

| GRADE              | AGE             |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| PRIMARY SCHOOL     | 05-12 years old |
| JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL | 12-15 years old |
| SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL | 15-18 years old |

Senior high school is the stage that you can choose to continue a classic
educational system or professional education system

I love traveling so I chose the professional education system, tourism school.
`Eventhough ethical hacker/cyber security was always be my dream!`. I got no
support from close family, not because they have problem with the subject but
it's because they don't have knowledge about it. So I gave up ICT and chose
tourism school :wilted_flower:

#### START LEARNING CODING

I am married and have 2 wonderful kids. After the corona outbreak I realise
benefits of working in tech industry `possibility to work from home` and also a
lot of oppurtunity. It motivates me to start learning codes and make a good
career in ICT.

## PROGRESS

This is my very first time looking around and seriously study about coding. As I
said before, I used to use a software for doing my hobby such as video editing,
etc..

Doing this assigment is kinda hard but also fun.

It is hard because I have no clue about github, gisthub, markdown, etc.

I have to search information on :

- Youtube
- Google
  1. Website
  2. Image

### FOUND IT

After searching around about What is Github, What is Markdown and How to write
markdown, I am finally found a good tutorial on youtube.

[Here is the link](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveGriffith-Prof3ssorSt3v3) _so
grateful to find his channel_

A `newbie` like me need this tutorial channel!

### I USED THE CODE ONCE

I used to use ~~a bit~~ _tiny!_ HTML code when I was still lives in Jakarta
working as a `Tour Consultant`.

Sometimes I have to update tour packages, itinerary or ticket prices on our
website.

For example:

```html
<b>BALI-LOMBOK TOUR 9D/8N by GARUDA INDONESIA</b>
```
